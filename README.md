# MLProject - A simple machine learning project 

This project understands how the student's performance (test scores) is affected by other variables such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch and Test preparation course.

# Detail 
## Features
In this project, we will use features:
* gender
* Ethnicity
* Parental level of education
* Lunch
* Test preparation course
* Writing score
* Reading score

to predict **math score** of a student

## Model
Some regression models(provided by sklearn) are use in this project:
* Linear, Lasso, Rigde
* RandomForestRegressor
* AdaBoostRegressor
* ...

Also using **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning and using **r2_score** for evaluation
